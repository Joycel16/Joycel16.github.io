Title: "Midterm"
Date: 11/29/18

The midterm analysis is the problem of the anwser in the mastery skill level it is very hard and challenge for me to work on for the understanding in math  of the prsentage of the problem in the analysis in the midterm assessment.
The mastery skill level will be high or low the skill was in the midterm assessment

For question 5 (56 / (2 * 4)) + (3 - -7) correct but I time 2 * 4 is equal to 8 and than I divide by 56 that equal to 7 and than I use -3 + 7 that equal to 10. So I add 7+10 is equal to 17 so I got it right.
