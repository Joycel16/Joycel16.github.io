The challenges was that it is little bit hard to do the flag but I almost had it right 
First I need to get the red rectangle and the white circle in the center of the flag and then I need the red moon crust on the side of the flag and it is the same for the star but the star need to rotate in the code.pyert.org on the program. After that I finished the flag the name of the flag is Tunisia.
So that why it was challenges for me so I try my best to finished the Tunisia.
